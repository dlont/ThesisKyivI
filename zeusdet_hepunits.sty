%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\newcommand{\Zctddesc}[1]{%
Charged particles were tracked in the central tracking detector (CTD)~\citeCTD,
which operated in a magnetic field of \unit{1.43}{\tesla} provided by a thin
superconducting coil. The CTD consisted of 72~cylindrical drift chamber
layers, organised in nine superlayers covering the polar-angle#1 region
\mbox{$\unit{15}{\degree}<\theta<\unit{164}{\degree}$}. The transverse-momentum resolution for
full-length tracks is $\sigma(p_T)/p_T=0.0058p_T\oplus0.0065\oplus0.0014/p_T$,
with $p_T$ in $\GeV$.}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%       -> CTD/MVD description (coordinate system footnote is given as argument)
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\newcommand{\Zctdmvddesc}[1]{%
In the kinematic range of the analysis, charged particles were tracked
in the central tracking detector (CTD)~\citeCTD and the microvertex
detector (MVD)~\citeMVD. These components operated in a magnetic
field of \unit{1.43}{\tesla} provided by a thin superconducting solenoid. The
CTD consisted of 72~cylindrical drift-chamber layers, organised in nine
superlayers covering the polar-angle#1 region
\mbox{$\unit{15}{\degree}<\theta<\unit{164}{\degree}$}.
%
The MVD silicon tracker consisted of a barrel (BMVD) and a forward
(FMVD) section. The BMVD contained three layers and provided
polar-angle coverage for tracks from $\unit{30}{\degree}$ to
$\unit{150}{\degree}$. The four-layer FMVD extended the polar-angle coverage in
the forward region to $\unit{7}{\degree}$. After alignment, the single-hit
resolution of the MVD was \unit{24}{\micron}. The transverse distance of closest
approach (DCA) of tracks to the nominal vertex in $X$--$Y$ was measured to have
a resolution, averaged over the azimuthal angle, of \unit{$(46 \oplus 122 /
p_{T})$}{\micron}, with $p_{T}$ in \GeV.  For CTD-MVD tracks that pass
through all nine CTD superlayers, the momentum resolution was
$\sigma(p_{T})/p_{T} = 0.0029 p_{T} \oplus 0.0081 \oplus
0.0012/p_{T}$, with $p_{T}$ in \GeV.}

\newcommand{\Zctdmvdsttdesc}[1]{%
In the kinematic range of the analysis, charged particles were tracked
in the central tracking detector (CTD)~\citeCTD, the microvertex
detector (MVD)~\citeMVD and the STT~\citeSTT. The CTD and the MVD
operated in a magnetic field of \unit{1.43}{\tesla} provided by a thin

polar-angle#1 region $\unit{15}{\degree}<\theta<\unit{164}{\degree}$. The MVD
silicon tracker consisted of a barrel (BMVD) and a forward (FMVD)
section. The BMVD provided polar angle coverage for tracks with three
measurements from \unit{30}{\degree} to \unit{150}{\degree}. The FMVD extended the

%       -> STT description (coordinate system footnote is given as argument)

\newcommand{\Zsttdesc}{%
The STT consisted of 48 sectors of two different sizes. Each sector
contained 192 (small sector) or 264 (large sector) straws of diameter
\unit{7.5}{\mm} arranged into 3 layers. The sectors were trapezoidal in shape
and each subtended an azimuthal angle of \unit{60}{\degree} -- 6 sectors
formed a so-called superlayer. A particle passing through the complete
detector traversed 8 superlayers, which were rotated around the beam
direction at angles of \unit{30}{\degree} or \unit{15}{\degree} to each other. The STT
covered the polar-angle region $\unit{5}{\degree}<\theta<\unit{23}{\degree}$.

%       -> CAL description
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\newcommand{\Zcaldesc}{%
The high-resolution uranium--scintillator calorimeter (CAL)~\citeCAL
consisted of three parts: the forward (FCAL), the barrel (BCAL) and
the rear (RCAL) calorimeters. Each part was subdivided transversely
into towers and longitudinally into one electromagnetic section (EMC)
and either one (in RCAL) or two (in BCAL and FCAL) hadronic sections
(HAC). The smallest subdivision of the calorimeter was called a cell.
The CAL energy resolutions, as measured under test-beam conditions,
were $\sigma(E)/E=0.18/\sqrt{E}$ for electrons and
$\sigma(E)/E=0.35/\sqrt{E}$ for hadrons, with $E$ in \GeV.}

%       -> HES description
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\newcommand{\Zhesdesc}{%
The position of electrons scattered at small angles to the
electron-beam directions was determined with the help of RHES\citeHES,
which consisted of a layer of approximately $10\,000$ (\unit{$2.96\times
3.32$}{\cm\squared}) silicon-pad detectors inserted in the RCAL at a
depth of 3.3 radiation lengths.}

%       -> MUON description
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\newcommand{\Zmuondesc}{%
The muon system consisted of rear, barrel (R/BMUON) and forward
(FMUON) tracking detectors. The B/RMUON consisted of limited--streamer
(LS) tube chambers placed behind the BCAL (RCAL), inside and outside a
magnetized iron yoke surrounding the CAL. The barrel and rear muon
chambers cover polar angles from \unit{34}{\degree} to \unit{135}{\degree} and from
\unit{135}{\degree} to \unit{171}{\degree}, respectively. The FMUON consisted of six
trigger planes of LS tubes and four planes of drift chambers covering
the angular region from \unit{5}{\degree} to \unit{32}{\degree}. The muon system
exploited the magnetic field of the iron yoke and, in the forward
direction, of two iron toroids magnetized to $\approx\unit{1.6}{\tesla}$
to provide an independent measurement of the muon momentum.}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%       -> BAC description
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\newcommand{\Zbacdesc}{%
The iron yoke surrounding the CAL was instrumented with proportional
drift chambers to form the Backing Calorimeter (BAC)~\citeBAC.  The
BAC consisted of 5142 aluminium chambers inserted into the gaps
between \unit{7.3}{\cm} thick iron plates (10, 9 and 7 layers in forecap,
barrel and rearcap, respectively) serving as calorimeter absorber.
The chambers were typically \unit{5}{\metre} long and had a wire spacing of
\unit{1.5}{\cm}. The anode wires were covered by \unit{50}{\cm} long cathode
pads. The BAC was equipped with energy
readout and position sensitive readout for muon tracking.  The former
was based on 1692 pad towers (\unit{$50 \times 50$}{\cm\squared}), providing an
energy resolution of $\sim$\unit{100}{\%}$/\sqrt E$, with $E$ in \GeV. The position information
from the wires allowed the reconstruction of muon trajectories in two
dimensions ($XY$ in barrel and $YZ$ in endcaps) with spatial accuracy
of a few \mm.}

\newcommand{\ZSixmTdesc}{%
Scattered electrons emerging from $eP$ interactions at very small
angles were detected in a small tungsten--scintillator calorimeter
located approximately \unit{6}{\metre} from the interaction point in the rear
direction, referred to as the ``6m-tagger''~\citeSixmT. For
electrons in the energy range $4.1 \le E_e \le 7.4$ the acceptance is
very close to one with very high purity.}
